### 👩🏻‍💻 Technologies

- **1. Python**
    
    When implementing the robot, the code is written using the Python programming language. The algorithm is designed to enable the robot to empathize and communicate with humans by implementing necessary actions. It analyzes the user's input and categorizes it into appropriate categories to generate appropriate responses or empathetic statements.
    
- **2. Google API**
    
    Google API refers to an interface provided by an operating system or programming language that allows applications to control the available functionalities. When performing Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT), Google's Speech API is used. The Google Cloud STT and TTS APIs are typically structured in a client-server architecture. Requests are sent to the Google API server, and responses are received in return. For Google Cloud TTS, the configuration is set to enable speech in both English and Korean simultaneously.
    
- **3. Speech recognition**
    
    Speech recognition refers to the process of interpreting human speech language into textual data by a computer. It involves the conversion of spoken language into written text.
    
- **4. Chat GPT**
    
    ChatGPT is an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. It generates human-like responses to text prompts and can be used for various applications such as customer support, content generation, and language translation. It analyzes context and generates coherent responses based on its training on a vast amount of text data. We use ChatGPT API and make it possible for the robot to speak seamlessly and naturally, without any awkwardness while talking with a person. and also we use it to health check and recommend a bible verse.
